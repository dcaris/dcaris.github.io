I hate it).</p>\n<p>I fancy myself as a self taught woodworker/maker, enjoying the craft of building furniture. Whilst I don't have as much time or space to dedicate to this hobby as I used, I still enjoy the content of my favourite woodworkers on YouTube and the craftmanship of local Australian woodworkers/joiners on Instagram.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"about"}}}]}}}
