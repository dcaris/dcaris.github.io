#### Who am I

Hey, my name is Daniel Caris and I am a Software Engineer from Brisbane, Australia.

#### What I do

I studied Information Technology at QUT and currently working as a Senior Software Engineer. Dotnet stack is my trade, Golang/AWS is my hobby.

#### What I do for fun

In my spare time, I'm either looking after my children, being a fantastic husband, surfing, or watching sport of any kind. happy to chat all day about NBA, AFL, and NFL.

I fancy myself as a self taught woodworker/maker, enjoying the craft of building furniture. The thrill of the journey of crafting a usable piece drives me to continue to hone my skills and learn from others. I spend a lot of my time following woodworking YouTubers to learn and follow their journey
