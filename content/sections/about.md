Hey, my name is Daniel Caris and I am a Software Developer from Brisbane, Australia.

I studied Information Technology at QUT and currently working as a Senior Software Developer. .NET stack is my specialty, however am enjoying delving into the Node.js and Javascript world.

In my spare time, I'm either looking after my children, being a fantastic husband, utilizing my wooworking skills to build furniture, surfing, or watching sport of any kind. I'm crazy about NBA, AFL, and NFL, but enjoy everything except cricket (I don't like cricket... oh no. I hate it).
