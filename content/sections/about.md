#### Who am I
Hey, my name is Daniel Caris and I am a Software Developer from Brisbane, Australia.

#### What I do
I studied Information Technology at QUT and currently working as a Senior Software Developer. .NET stack is my specialty, however am enjoying delving into the Node.js and Javascript world.

#### What I do for fun
In my spare time, I'm either looking after my children, being a fantastic husband,  surfing, or watching sport of any kind. I'm crazy about NBA, AFL, and NFL, but enjoy everything except cricket (I don't like cricket... oh no. I hate it).

I fancy myself as a self taught woodworker/maker, enjoying the craft of building furniture. Whilst I don't have as much time or space to dedicate to this hobby as I used, I still enjoy the content of my favourite woodworkers on YouTube and the craftmanship of local Australian woodworkers/joiners on Instagram.
