                Hey, my name is Daniel Caris and I am a Software Developer from Gold Coast, Australia.
                <br />
                I studied Information Technology at QUT and currently work at Virtus Health as a Senior Software Developer. .NET stack is my specialty, however am enjoying delving into the Node.js and Javascript world.
                <br />
                In my spare time, I'm either looking after my children, being a fantastic husband, trying to be a handyman around the house, surfing, or watching sport of any time. I'm crazy about NRL, AFL, and NFL, but enjoy everything except cricket (I don't like cricket... oh no. I hate it)
                <br />
                This site will contain my ramblings on items I'm keen to chat about. Trying to improve my Daily Fantasy Sports skills (DFS) so I'll be delving into the realm of sports analytics to try and gain an edge
