            <p>
                Hey, my name is Daniel Caris and I am a Software Developer from Brisbane, Australia.
                <br />
                I studied Information Technology at QUT and currently work at Virtus Health as a Senior Software Developer. .NET stack is my specialty, however am enjoying delving into the Node.js and Javascript world.
                In my spare time, I'm either looking after my children, being a fantastic husband, trying to be a handyman around the house, surfing, or watching sport of any time. I'm crazy about NRL, AFL, and NFL, but enjoy everything except cricket (I don't like cricket... oh no. I hate it)
